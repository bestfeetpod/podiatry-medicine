1.Roberto DPM:
 - Initially Prefab FO with the modification of
  - Morton’s extension
  - Reverse Morton’s extension
 - Stiff soled shoes
 - If pain reduce, move onto Custom Foot orthotics (FO)
2.Bull DPM:
 - Custom FO (with Morton’s extension) + NSAIDs
 - Footwear: Stiff soled shoes, Stability shoes
3.Baravarian DPM:
 - Carbon foot plates in shoes or stiff soled shoes
 - Custom FO wuth the modification of 
  - Morton’s extension
  - 1st Ray Cut Out 
4.Watson DPM:
 - Stiff soled shoes
 - Not keen to Morton’s extension insert as he often found patients unable to tolerate
5.Fidler DPM:
 - Topical or Oral NSAIDs
 - Morton’s extension insole initially
 - Activity modification


###Theory
 - Stiff soled shoes → Limit joint movement → helps to calm down the inflamed synovium
 - If footwear change does not help, fluroscopic-guided intra-articular steroid injection for pain relief. (Cortico-steroid injection)
 - Steroid injection has a potential risk of subdermal fat atrophy and skin thinning over the 1st MPJ, which increases the risk of incisional complications
